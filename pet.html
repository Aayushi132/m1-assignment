        <h3>What is responsible pet adoption?</h3>
        <p>
          Once a pet is chosen, the owner should ensure the pet has been spayed
          or neutered and properly identified. The responsibility to the animal
          should be a commitment for the lifetime of the pet. If a situation
          arises that the owner can no longer provide a suitable household for
          the animal, it should be the owners first priority to re-home the pet.
          The AVMA presents guidelines for being a responsible pet owner.
        </p>
        <h3>What are rescue animals?</h3>
        <p>
          A rescue animal is an animal that has been placed in a new home after
          being abused, neglected, or abandoned by its previous owner. The term
          can also apply to animals that are found as strays, surrendered by
          owners for a variety of reasons, including relationship breakdowns,
          moving home where the owner is unable or unwilling to take their pets,
          or elderly people who are not permitted to take their pets into a
          nursing home..
